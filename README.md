# Music Library

## Main Funcitons

### User to scroll through the songs

### Showing all the songs that have been "starred."

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Thought process

### Two panels

Because I am showing two rows of list (all, star), I will want to divide space.
If I have enough time, make it responsive, so if the screen is small, stack, instead of dividing.
Each column will have Title (all,star)
In front of each listing, depending on the column, it will have icon. (regular star for star column, empty star for all column)
If the empty star of all column is clicked, the song will be added to the star list.
The all list should have a search bar, to filter the list.
